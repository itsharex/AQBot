## FAQ

### macOS: "App Is Damaged" or "Cannot Verify Developer"

Since the application is not signed by Apple, macOS may show one of the following prompts:

- "AQBot" is damaged and can't be opened
- "AQBot" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

**Steps to resolve:**

**1. Allow apps from "Anywhere"**

```bash
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

Then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Security** and select **Anywhere**.

**2. Remove the quarantine attribute**

```bash
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AQBot.app
```

> Tip: You can drag the app icon onto the terminal after typing `sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine `.

**3. Additional step for macOS Ventura and later**

After completing the above steps, the first launch may still be blocked. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, then click **Open Anyway** in the Security section. This only needs to be done once.
